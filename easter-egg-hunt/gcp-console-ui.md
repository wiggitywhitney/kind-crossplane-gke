Click on the `newclusterwhodis`cluster.

Click the `NODES` tab.

From here you can click into the `newnodepoolwhodis` Node Pool and then scroll down to `Metadata` to find the Easter egg label.


Or instead, from the `NODES` tab, you can click into the actual machine details which will have a name something like `gke-newclusterwhodis-newnodepoolwhodi-82f2eb4d-f2pp`.

From there, click the `DETAILS` tab and find the Easter egg label among the 30 or so labels that are listed there. 

Heck yes you did it! You're friggin awesome!
